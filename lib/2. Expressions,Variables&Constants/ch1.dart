/*Challenge 1: Variable Dogs
Declare an int variable called dogs and set that equal to the number of dogs you own.
Then imagine you bought a new puppy and increment the dogs variable by one.*/

void main() {
  int dogs = 2;

  dogs += 1; //shorthand of this dogs = dogs + 1;
  //dogs++ ; to increase just by 1
  print(dogs);
}
